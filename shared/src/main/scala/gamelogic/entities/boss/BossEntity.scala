/**
  * A BossEntity is the super class of all Boss instances.
  *
  * A Boss is the main enemy that players have to fight during a boss. There is usually one (but possibly several) boss
  * during a given fight. Once the boss is dead, the game is over and player won.
  *
  * A boss is very similar to a player in what it can do (it has life, it moves and it has abilities). The main
  * difference is that the boss is much more powerful than the players, and they have to team up in order to kill it.
  *
  * A boss often has "adds", which are other entities helping it in some way.
