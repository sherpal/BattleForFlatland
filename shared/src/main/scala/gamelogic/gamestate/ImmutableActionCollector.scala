  * Create a complete picture of the game at time T, with its full history up to `timeToOldestGameState` millis earlier.

  * An element of the list is a couple GameState, List[GameAction] where the list is sorted from oldest to

  * from newest to oldest.
  *

  * then we have

  * @param timeBetweenGameStates time between two game states. This value should typically be of the order magnitude you
  *                               are willing to accept going back in time (with a small margin). Expressed in game
  *                               units (millis for BFF). Defaults to 2000.
