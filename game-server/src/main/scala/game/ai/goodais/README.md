# Good AIs

This package (and sub-packages) contain implementation for AIs which play by replacing a player.

These AIs will need to be specific to every boss. They will probably play better on their own, but nothing will prevent a human player to play among them.

Bosses have a given configuration for beating them. The implemented AIs will reflect that, and players playing among them will need to cope with that.
