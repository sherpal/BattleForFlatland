# To implement

- implement obstacles and path finding for AIs
- allow to customize keys
- allow to go fullscreen
- mini health bar at entities positions (done for boss 102 hounds, should be easily generalisable)
- integrating sounds
- allow players to put markers on the ground to mark positions
- show the game options to the people not game creators
- class description documentation
- improve end of game feeling (don't return directly to menu game)
- don't target boss if other entity at the same place
- key to target furthest ally/enemy
- forbidding players to join a game if it is "launched"
- improve game assets in general
- the life frame of a dead player should not vanish entirely
- show player colours in their frames
- put a kind of "halo" on the selected player to help visualize who is currently targeted
- enforce limit in number of players allowed in a given boss

# Done but need improvement

- icon for browser bar (simply change the `icon.ico` in `frontend/src/main/resources`)

# Bugs

- sometimes the game crashes at the very beginning when clicking on "Start Fight". Unclear (yet) how to reproduce
- quite slow on Firefox
